# GLibR
A reimplementation of GLib under a permissive license.

## Why
Because lots of things need it and Iglunix isn't allowed to use
any GNU software.

## Opinions
In my opinion, gobject is bloated and a much simpler object system
could be implemented. If i have the time to, I will but not
in this project as this aims to be API compatible with GLib.
